Version 0.5: January 15, 2015

Change the modeling of data relationships:

Previously: ModelEntityDataRelationship, ModelStructuredDataRelationship
- These 2 types were intended for data relationships from an entity or structured data type respectively to a datatype (scalar or structured)
  This would complicate the binding to OWL where the distinction between scalar vs. structured datatype matters (OWL DataType vs. OWL Class)

Now: Distinguish data relationships from entities vs. structured data types and to scala vs. structured datatypes

- This results in 4 kinds of relationships at the TBox level:
ModelDataRelationshipFromEntityToScalar
ModelDataRelationshipFromEntityToStructure
ModelDataRelationshipFromStructureToScalar
ModelDataRelationshipFromStructureToStructure

- and 4 at the ABox level:
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromEntityToScalar
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromEntityToStructure
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromStructureToScalar
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromStructureToStructure

Use sbt-license-plugin, version 0.1.4, which incorporates the functionality to format the license header for all sources

Version 0.3: January 14, 2015

New unit test: 'OMFVocabularyTest' based on patterns found in the IMCE foundation ontologies
New concrete type: 'ModelEntityAspect' (e.g., base:IdentifiedElement)
New concrete axiom: 'EntityDefinitionAspectSubClassAxiom'
Add support for specifying 'abstract' concepts & relationships
Add support for specifying the names of the unreified relationship and, optionally, of the unreified inverse relationship

Version 0.2: January 13, 2015

Refactor the API for a factory-oriented paradigm for construction.
Previously, the API had "make..." constructors which were difficult
to binding to factory-oriented APIs like OWLAPI or MD's UML.
