Version 0.8.1: February 2, 2015

scalaz-stream dependency

Version 0.8: January 28, 2015

updated IRI operations (removed toObjectPropertyIRI because the naming convention is not a strict requirement for the reification pattern)
updated test: IRITests (iri => backbone conversions)
new test: IMCEFoundationLoadTest

Version 0.7: January 21, 2015

Separate the operations for immutable vs. mutable graphs to simplify bindings.

Version 0.6.2: January 21, 2015

Refactoring based on Semmle static analysis

Version 0.6.1: January 20, 2015

Refactoring based on Semmle static analysis

Version 0.6: January 18, 2015

Added operation to check whether an IRI is a backbone IRI
Added operations to save instance & terminology graphs
Updated OWLVocabularyTest to save terminology graphs constructed & verify the construction after loading them back

Version 0.5: January 15, 2015

Change the modeling of data relationships:

Previously: ModelEntityDataRelationship, ModelStructuredDataRelationship
- These 2 types were intended for data relationships from an entity or structured data type respectively to a datatype (scalar or structured)
  This would complicate the binding to OWL where the distinction between scalar vs. structured datatype matters (OWL DataType vs. OWL Class)

Now: Distinguish data relationships from entities vs. structured data types and to scala vs. structured datatypes

- This results in 4 kinds of relationships at the TBox level:
ModelDataRelationshipFromEntityToScalar
ModelDataRelationshipFromEntityToStructure
ModelDataRelationshipFromStructureToScalar
ModelDataRelationshipFromStructureToStructure

- and 4 at the ABox level:
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromEntityToScalar
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromEntityToStructure
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromStructureToScalar
ModelInstanceDataRelationshipFromStructureToStructure

Version 0.4: January 14, 2015

Use sbt-license-plugin, version 0.1.4, which incorporates the functionality to format the license header for all sources

Version 0.3: January 14, 2015

New unit test: 'OMFVocabularyTest' based on patterns found in the IMCE foundation ontologies
New concrete type: 'ModelEntityAspect' (e.g., base:IdentifiedElement)
New concrete axiom: 'EntityDefinitionAspectSubClassAxiom'
Add support for specifying 'abstract' concepts & relationships
Add support for specifying the names of the unreified relationship and, optionally, of the unreified inverse relationship

Version 0.2: January 13, 2015

Refactor the API for a factory-oriented paradigm for construction.
Previously, the API had "make..." constructors which were difficult
to binding to factory-oriented APIs like OWLAPI or MD's UML.

Version 0.1: January 12, 2015
